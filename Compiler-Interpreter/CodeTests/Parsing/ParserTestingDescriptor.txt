These tests are designed to ensure
	1) That the current syntax is valid and complete
	2) That the parser can parse the current syntax correctly
	3) That the parser can generate the correct tree/bytecode for the syntax
	4) That correct and useful errors are generated by the parser (eventually)
	5) That the parser runs efficiently

Included in this filter are 
	1) Syntactically correct files
	2) Syntactically ambiguous files
	3) Syntactically wrong files
