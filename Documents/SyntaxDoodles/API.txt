How capabilities should the dust program API provide to programmers (from a c++ perspective for now)

Run and load dust files / strings of dust code
	loadFile/loadString vs. run

If we're just developing an interpreter for C++, that's really all I need
	See work on autoLua
	Want to set the variable 'ksjdbf' to 3
		dust.run("ksjdbf: 3");

	Want to then get the value of 'ksjdbf'
		int ksjdbf = dust.run("ksjdbf");			// possibly (it might be advantageous to provide another syntax)
