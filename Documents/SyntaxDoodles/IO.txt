Console
	Output
		print ""

	Input
		x: read

		x: read \x => int?		// or alternately readIf, readNext, readAll

	Note: print and read are mutable, io.print and io.read are not

Output
	io.print(x)
	print(x	)							## formatting ???

	io.writer							## default class that handles output
		print = io.writer(io.std.out)	## print is just an instance of the class on the standard output

Input
	x: io.read							## I'm thinking to have the reading performed through regexes
	x: read io.digit					## This line performs a read using the digit regex
	print(x + 5)						## The question then becomes, should x be implictly converted to an int or should the conversion be explicit

	io.reader							## default class that handles input
		read = io.reader(io.std.in)		## read is just an instance of the class on the standard input

File
	To create variables that read/write data from files, just initialize an io.reader/io.writer class with the file name (and any accessors)
		fin: io.reader "file", [accessors]
		fout: io.writer "file", [accessors]

Logging
	io.log ""
