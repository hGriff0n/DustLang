Module system		## TODO: Specify
	Each file is a unique module that must be manually imported through a require statement
	I should add the possibility of importing some things by name (ala using std::string)

require = {req_assign}?require {string}
	req_assign = {var_id}: *

Require loads the file given by the string into a table
	Evaluation is performed as a block object, not as a table object
		However the scope is not deleted
			Therefore the require action/evaluation must set the created Block's save_scope field to true before evaluation

	The table is then assigned to the var_id given in req_assign
		If a req_assign is not given, the var_id is created from the file string
		If a req_assign is not given, the table is assigned in the global scope
			I don't think I can actually do this in the current grammar
				I might be able to if I do the chaining parsers (the assignment parser could easily handle setting this)

		Ex. g: require "graph"
			require "graph"				## equivalent to "_G.graph: require "graph""
			print(g = graph)			## true

	If the file is already loaded, require reuses the loaded table
		Might delete the tables if no longer referenced
					
How will modules work
	Modules is just a way of specifying which "functions" and "variables" are visible to a user of the table
	Could possibly be implemented using metamethods (Add at file end)

	
Block evaluation
	Evaluating a Block always requires the loading of a new scope, regardless of execution location (possibly subject to change)
		The "main file" Block loads the global scope into curr_scp
		All other Blocks must create their scope

	Ending a Block evaluation requires one of two actions
		Delete the scope if the save_scope field is not set
		Push the scope on the stack if save_scope is set
