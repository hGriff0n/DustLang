If we allow all types to define metamethods, it is possible to create the weird c-style array indexing within dust
	Int._nindex: \t -> t[self]						## 3[t] = t[3] and 3.hello = "hello"[3] = 'l'

Multiple comparators
	Take use of the work on multiple assignment to enable multiple comparisons to be performed as part of one expression

	"i = 0 and j = 2" => "i, j = 0, 2"
	"i = 0 and i = j" => "i, i = 0, j"

Change inheritance syntax
	Change the inheritance operator for specifying which types a new type inherits from '++' to '<-' to match the proposed type testing syntax
