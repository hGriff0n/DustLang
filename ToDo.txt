Notes
	PEGTL Submodule interactions can only be done with the Git Shell
	For updating the local PEGTL repository
		In Git Shell, navigate to "Visual Studio 2015/MyResources/MyLib"
		Currently, delete the existing PEGTL directory
		Execute "git clone https://github.com/ColinH/PEGTL.git"
	Using newline in repl/testing
		Just add "\n" in the automated tests (although the display is wonky)
		For the repl loop, use getmultiline
			getmultiline waits until [ENTER] is hit twice before accepting

Opinions on adapting code to use the C++ Common Code Standards and the GSL
	I feel like this would be a good idea on the whole
		I currently can't explain why though

	However there are many downsides the mean I won't implement it yet
		Time-costly to go through and implement for the whole project
			This will only get worse as time goes on however
		I'm not used to the new standards
			Error prone if I perform the switch while I'm figuring this stuff out
			If I don't understand my current code at times, how can I accurately adapt it to the new standard?
		Some of	the juicy stuff is not available yet (static analyzers)

Timeline
	0 Bugfixes / Improvements
		Improvements to the Testing suite
			Handling of non-printable values, specifically tables and nil
				Currently have to require_true of a comparison
				Could just use "require_type" for these (or the type checking syntax)
			Add table specific functions (?)
			"Global Review" is duplicated at the end, consider removing it
			Consider splitting test sections (see comments in Testing.h)
		Consider removing the test for operator isDefd in com
			Would remove ambiguity in code execution
			"3" - 3 => String._op- not defined
				This would likely mean I can improve com lookup implementation
		Improve the implementation of GC
		Determine whether 0 should be equal to true or false
			Currently, 0 => true
		Think of changing how operator resolution is handled (especially for equals)
			Currently "[3] = 3" evaluates to true
			Consider adding "metadata" (such as com_t when calling other operators ???)
		Change tables to copy-on-write semantics
			Currently tables are references (ie. pointers)
				This is passable but not what I want from the language
		Redo how get/set are handled (in relation to exception throwing)
		Check EvalState::setVar static typing conversion handling (I don't think it'll work, wrong direction)
			Also consider changing ts.convertible(t1, t2) to ts.convertible(f, t)
		Implement Table::okayKey and Table::okayValue and provide a way to change behavior
			These methods are how "3: 3" will be prevented in the global scope and allowed in tables
			Also allow for restricting key and values based on given functions
		Check that Collector<T>::StorageType destructor works for pointer and non-pointer types
			Currently branches on std::is_pointer<T>::value
		See VagueToDo.txt

	1 Interpreter Update
		Add in the capability to restrict Tester to only output failed tests
			Color some stuff on failed tests red ???
				Maybe create a custom manipulator
					See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/799599/c-custom-stream-manipulator-that-changes-next-item-on-stream
					See: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/ios_base/iword
					See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27400292/colored-text-in-windows-command-prompt-in-one-line
				How to do it for windows
					#include <Windows.h>
					HANDLE hcon = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
					SetConsoleTextAttribute(hcon, FOREGROUND_RED);
					constexpr auto normal_console = FOREGROUND_RED | FOREGROUND_GREEN | FOREGROUND_BLUE;
		Fix some bugs
				
	2 Parser Rewrite v. II
		Redo how scoping is handled by the parser
			Add a "scoping" rule at the beginning of expr
				This scoping rule will work similar to Python (need a "scope" stack?)
				Block gets deleted from the grammar
					Means I can't completely describe everything in the grammar as a single expression
						Should still parse that way though
				The grammar rule just matches any number of "scope" characters
					The action will handle the control push/popping (allows custom control structures for loops/branches/etc.)
			Try to simplify the grammar if possible
		Fix Grammar so that Testing.99 throws an error at parse time (not at runtime) ???
			Or should I (it would certainly be extremely difficult to debug)
				Assignment => value which can be used in another assignment
		Improve Exception Support
		Rework Assignment to be performed left->right
			Changes "a, b:* 3" to multiply a by 3 (before excepting on the 3)
				Stops "a, b:* nil, 3" from multiplying b by 3
		Rewrite the parser so that everything works well together

	3 Control Statements (For/While/Do-While/If/Else/...)
		Update project version to 0.7.1
		Be able to write control statements with correct execution
			Have variable scoping work correctly

	4 Function Calling		ie. print("Hello, World!")
		Implement the evaluation hooks/etc. to be able to call functions	# Get functions callable
			Hard coded translations at this time
			Have the basic syntax and semantics working (Argument passing, etc.)
		Be able to store functions as values
			Get assignment to work as expected with functions
		Convert Types completely to impl::Table for storage concerns
			Allow Type methods to be called using '.'/'[]' syntax
				Current grammar disallows type_ids to be used outside of new_type and type_checking
			Allow Type methods to be called using '.'/'[]' syntax on non-table values and variables
				Current AST construction assumes a VarName node exists (not guaranteed for non-variables)
		Move function calling work into the _op() metamethod
		Optional: No parens syntax

	5 Dust Function Definition
		Update project version to 0.8.1
		Abstract the previous framework to allow for Dust functions to be conceivably executed
		Add in the correct syntax and action calls to create dust functions

	6 Grammar Framework Update
		Potentially change the grammar to follow the basic framework in "lua53_parse.h"
		Update all documents to ensure that they reflect the current language spec
		Update the readme to show of recent aditions
		Determine the next set of features that need to be implemented

	7 Type/Table metamethods



Notes (In case I forget some of my decisions)
	3 + e: 4	=> (3 + e)[: 4]		/> (3 + (e: 4))		// To difficult to modify the grammar. I can't find anywhere that I expected it
	(e: 3) + 3 * e = 12									// The assignment is evaluated before the multiplication (left->right evaluation). This has some problems with current organization
	a, b:+ 2											// I'm going to go with the current semantics for now for simplicity. However, it still possible for it to be changed in the future
	a, b: b, c: 9										// Again, I'm going to use the current semantics for simplicity. There also would be difficulty in correctly parsing it otherwise due to the overlap and the fact that an assignment is an expression
	Nil is defined as Bool for the sake of operator resolution (something to watch out for?)
