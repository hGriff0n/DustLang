Notes
	PEGTL Submodule interactions can only be done with the Git Shell
	For updating the local PEGTL repository
		In Git Shell, navigate to "Visual Studio 2015/MyResources/MyLib"
		Currently, delete the existing PEGTL directory
		Execute "git clone https://github.com/ColinH/PEGTL.git"
	Using newline in repl/testing
		Just add "\n" in the automated tests (although the display is wonky)
		For the repl loop, use getmultiline
			getmultiline waits until [ENTER] is hit twice before accepting

Opinions on adapting code to use the C++ Common Code Standards and the GSL
	I feel like this would be a good idea on the whole
		I currently can't explain why though

	However there are many downsides the mean I won't implement it yet
		Time-costly to go through and implement for the whole project
			This will only get worse as time goes on however
		I'm not used to the new standards
			Error prone if I perform the switch while I'm figuring this stuff out
			If I don't understand my current code at times, how can I accurately adapt it to the new standard?
		Some of	the juicy stuff is not available yet (static analyzers)

Timeline
	1 Scoping and multi-lined grammar
		How to define Scoping
			Continuation Expressions
				Any expression that uses {seps} can be written using multiple lines
					The parser will use the scope of the statement start when parsing the expression
						The code on following lines can be indented willy-nilly
					I can also provide a {c_seps} that does the same functionality (keep {sep} = ' ')
				For table indexing, should the '.' immediately follow the table or can there be a {seps} in between
					This would be a minor step to allowing indexing to be a continuation expression
					ie. Should "foo() . bar . call()" parse correctly

			Determine the difference between a tab and x spaces															# Scoping whitespace rules
				How does Python resolve this problem
					Requiring a ':' to begin a new scope (ie. do keyword)?
						But what about lambdas
					Line joining
						Python uses the '\' character to join physical lines into logical lines
					Space and tab are different characters
						Scoping is only introduced with tabs
					Copy-paste
						Translate all tabs to spaces (or vice versa) before parsing

		Be able to create and parse scopes using tabbing																# How to implement Scoping
			How am I going to parse scopes
				Have a "scope" rule that handles all scoping interaction
					For better granularity, have scp and diff_scp structs
						scp matches if the scope depth remains the same
						diff_scp matches if the scope depth changes	
							diff_scp handles Block creation correctly
							would i need to initially push a NEW_SCOPE then
						both consume their input on success
					This abstracts away a lot of the problems
						However the purpose of the "block" Rule is now a bit muddied
						How would a Block be able to be reused
							I can solve Tables by changing the grammar to use expr_list or a variant instead of block
								Or I can use block (and the method described for loops) and enforce a unifrom indentation
									I feel this can be very bad from an AST construction standpoint

							How to implement loops and branching structures
								Have all loops and branching structures use a similar form
									def = {decl} {block}			# if-elsif-else might be a bit complicated
									The decl action sets up the scoping rules for the parsing of the block
										Increments the scope depth counter and pushes a NEW_SCOPE on the stack
									The block can now parse correctly
										When the scope is exited, the requisite block is created
										However, the block rule won't end under the current formulation
									When the block rule ends, the def rule can then combine the decl and the block

							How to define block rule so that it can complete the necessary parsing for the above section
								block parsing begins at depth = x and ends at depth < x			# This would be recursive (i think)

			How am I going to store scopes
				Temporary v. Static Scopes (Loops v. Functions, etc.)
					Temporary scopes are not stored in memory, Static scopes are
						Temporary scopes are created and destroyed as needed
					Will I even be having static scopes (Scopes that are stored)
					

		Implement scoped declarations and access
			ModifyEvalState to use scoping to store variables
			Implement global and local variable distinction				## be able to access "masked" variables

		Possibly replace global variable storage with the scoping structures/mechanisms
			Good way of implementing namespaces/modules (map from string -> scope)
				Normal "scoping" would use a stack (defaults to empty)
			Could scoping also be used for tables ???

	2 Type Definitions and Table Syntax
		Have the ability to create new types and assign inheritance relationships
		Have some interaction with type ids, if only for debugging purposes
		Add a basic recognition of Table syntax (the grammar accepts tables)
			Possible Table Implementation
				Have the Table ASTNode inherit from Block
				Table::eval sets a scope, then calls Block::eval, which sets the variables in the scope
					However, there's problems in setting default keys
						It's a simple question of Assign vs. ASTNode
						If the node is castable to Assign, then it doesn't need the default key
							Printing is still a problem
							Would ',' then become an expression seperator (outside of the list functionality) ???
							There's also the implications on the range syntax (would this need tables)
				Then Table = [ <expr>* ] (instead of [ <arg_list> ])
	3 Table Semantics
		Indexable arrays
		Determine how to access the arrays
		Assigning values to the arrays
		_nindex and _index metamethods
		Arrays -> Tables (any key)
		Empty Table => false
	4 Keyword Recognition
		Update pegtl library
		Get the grammar to recognize various keywords
		Work on the framework for adding keywords to the AST
			BinaryKeyword is a temporary addition to test and/or
		Possibly clean up EvalState and Grammar
	5 Exception and Error update
		Update exceptions and errors to better fit the new features
		Add exception catching and error functions
		Add throw/catch (or whatever I call it in dust) functionality
			I won't have the syntax yet though
		Improve Exception Error Messages
			Mainly work on Exception constructors
	6 Strict Parser Update
		Update the parser so that wrong programs will ouput an error (as opposed to interpreting a subset)
	7 Function Calling		ie. print("Hello, World!")
		Basic syntax and semantics (Argument passing, etc.)			## Get functions callable
		Can assign functions and then call the assigned function	## a = print and a(3)
			Would this necessitate having _op() syntax work be done???
		_op() syntax (Metamethods ???)
		Optional: No parens syntax
	8 Keyword Framework Update
		Potentially change the grammar to follow the basic framework in "lua53_parse.h"
	9 Scoping Improvement Work
	10 Control Structures
	11 Table definition (This can go before scoping)
	12 Function definition (no lambdas)
	13 Metamethods (converting syntax into function calls)
	...

Other
	Exceptions and error handling
		Stack out of data
		No defined conversion
		...
	Make the parser reject ill-formed input
	String escape characters

Notes (In case I forget some of my decisions)
	3 + e: 4	=> (3 + e)[: 4]		/> (3 + (e: 4))		// To difficult to modify the grammar. I can't find anywhere that I expected it
	(e: 3) + 3 * e = 12									// The assignment is evaluated before the multiplication (left->right evaluation). This has some problems with current organization
	a, b:+ 2											// I'm going to go with the current semantics for now for simplicity. However, it still possible for it to be changed in the future
	a, b: b, c: 9										// Again, I'm going to use the current semantics for simplicity. There also would be difficulty in correctly parsing it otherwise due to the overlap and the fact that an assignment is an expression
